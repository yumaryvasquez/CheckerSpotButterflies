### Welcome!

  This website was created for the NRT-Interdisciplinary Computational Graduate Education program. The group behind this website are made up of graduate students who are a mathmatician, a biologist, a cognitive scientist, and a physicist. We originally came together to look at the sentiment of tweets about climate change and legislative policies that have been affected by these sentiments. Throughout the project we have decided to settle on the [Juliana vs United States](https://www.youthvgov.org/meet-the-youth) case where young members of the community are suing the United States for not doing enough to alleviate severe climate change. Therefore we have named our project the Checkerspot Butterflies, a species that has been declining due to climate change.
